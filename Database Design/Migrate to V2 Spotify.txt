How would I migrate my schema to v2 of the app?

In order to allow multiple playlists I would add a new table user_playlists with a foreign key to the users table and a foreign key to the playlists table

Multiple account types: 
- add a new column account_type to the users table 
- update the account_type column in the user_playlists table to reference the users table
